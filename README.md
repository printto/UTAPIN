# UTAPIN Project
### UTAU Community Website

## What is this website for?
I'm creating a website where everyone can pin their UTAU to the board (homepage) and everyone can "like" or "comment" on that UTAU's profile.

## Features
- Everyone can register and log to the website and post their own UTAU.
- Everyone can "like" or "comment" on that UTAU.
- From the "like" value, we can have weekly, monthly or yearly ranking.
- We can have more features in the future (events, musicboard etc.)

## Software used
- Atom
- MongoDB (mLab)
- Node.js
- PUG/Jade
- Javascript
- HTML5/CSS
- Boostrap 4
- GitHub
